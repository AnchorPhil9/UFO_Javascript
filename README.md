# UFO Sightings with Javascript

## Intro
Dana would like to make a webpage that allows users to seamlessly access and look up particular UFO sightings. While she has succeeded with her first webpage, she'd like more options for users to better specify the parameters of those sightings like the location they occurred in as well as their shapes. With a combination of Javascript, Bootcamp, CSS, and HTML formatting, we'll help modify Dana's UFO data webpage to be more search-friendly.

## Initial Limitations
In Dana's first webpage, users had access to the entire table of Dana's UFO data, and if they wished, they could filter the information by date (in MM/DD/YYYY format) with the click of a button. Still, when looking up days with plenty of UFO data like 1/1/2010, users who are after more specific parameters (like circle-shaped UFOs) may not like having to use their browser's Find function to single out their ideal data entries. Not to mention
that should Dana feel like adding more months (or even years) of UFO data, users' tedium may rise as they spam the Find function for multiple parameters. As such, it would behoove Dana to update her webpage with additional filters aside from date.
